# Design_Pattern_Solid_principles_assign
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

SOLID principles are a set of recommendations to design and write better software systems. 
They were proposed by Robert C. Martin.
Their purposes are:
Write more maintainable code, which it's easy to change.
Write code which can be extended with new functionalities easily.
Write more readable code.

Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or 
Adaptive software development.

# SOLID is conformed by 5 principles:
           Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
           Open Closed Principle (OCP)
           Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
           Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
           Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
# In this article, we will be discussing these 3 principles.
      Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
      Open Closed Principle (OCP)
      Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
